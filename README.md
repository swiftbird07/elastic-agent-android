Elastic Agent Android is an unofficial implementation of the Elastic Agent for Android devices, bringing the powerful observability and management features of the Elastic Stack to the Android ecosystem. With Elastic Agent Android, you can enroll your Android devices into a Fleet server and start collecting a wide range of data directly into Elasticsearch, allowing for real-time monitoring, alerting, and analysis.

## Use Cases

Elastic Agent Android aims to extend the powerful features of Elastic Observability and Security to mobile devices, providing detailed insights and security monitoring for Android devices. Whether you're managing a fleet of corporate devices or looking for a way to integrate mobile device data into your Elastic Stack, Elastic Agent Android offers a versatile and powerful solution.

## Features

Elastic Agent Android supports a variety of components that collect different types of data from the Android device, including:

- **Location:** Sends periodic location updates to Elasticsearch, with configurable intervals.
- **Network Logs:** Collects network logs (DNS, TCP connections) provided by the Android OS.
- **Security Logs:** Gathers security-related logs, offering insights into the device's security posture.
- **Self Log:** Logs the agent's own operational logs for diagnostics and monitoring.

> **Note:** The Network Logs and Security Logs components require the device to be configured as a device owner. More details can be found in our [wiki page](#).
